                <p>After serving in the army, I returned and studied more about the dogs I had met and research for new breeds as well.
                    I did share about this with my friend - Chad and he is a vet doctor and he is so happy for the idea and support it.
                    <br><br>
                    That's the reason I published this website to share to share about my experience as well as puppy care tips for everyone with the consultance from Chad.
